we can use flipbooks as follows:

  flipbook/
    1.png
    2.png
    3.png
    ...

 my $flipbook = Cv->CreateCameraCapture("/path/to/directory");
 while (my $frame = $flipbook->QueryFrame) {
   $frame->ShowImage;
   Cv->WaitKey(33);  # 30fps
 }

The flipbook is one of the animations.  It is very primitive.  I think
this interface is the easiest way to operate animations.
